# RandomRoll_iOS16
A simple dice rolling app with score display. 

## About

Rondom Roller app is a part of my online iOS development bootcamp from Angela Yu on Udemy. I decided to take the concept of a beginner app and make it my own by designing the UI and implementing the score. Some of the skills learned from this project: image manipulation, string interpulation, button assignment and functionality.
